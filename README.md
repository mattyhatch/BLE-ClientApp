This app allows the user to use their android phone as a Bluetooth Low Energy GATT client. It does this by first asking for your location permissions
because Bluetooth Low Energy needs your location to work correctly. It then gives you a scan button that when pressed, scans the area for Bluetooth Low Energy devices
and has them appear on the screen in a recycler view. Pressing on one of the devices lets you connect your phone to that device over BLE.
